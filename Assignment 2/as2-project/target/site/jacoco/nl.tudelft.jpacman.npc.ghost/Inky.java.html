/**
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An implementation of the classic Pac-Man ghost Bashful.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Nickname: Inky. Bashful has truly earned his name. In a game of chicken
 * between Pac-Man and Bashful, Bashful might just run away. This isn't always
 * the case, but if Blinky is right behind you, it's a safe bet. He can't be
 * scared off while he patrols the southeast portion of the maze. In Japan, his
 * name is Kimagure/Aosuke.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;b&gt;AI:&lt;/b&gt; Bashful has the most complicated AI of all. When the ghosts are
 * not patrolling their home corners, Bashful considers two things: Shadow's
 * location, and the location two grid spaces ahead of Pac-Man. Bashful draws a
 * line from Shadow to the spot that is two squares in front of Pac-Man and
 * extends that line twice as far. Therefore, if Bashful is alongside Shadow
 * when they are behind Pac-Man, Bashful will usually follow Shadow the whole
 * time. But if Bashful is in front of Pac-Man when Shadow is far behind him,
 * Bashful tends to want to move away from Pac-Man (in reality, to a point very
 * far ahead of Pac-Man). Bashful is affected by a similar targeting bug that
 * affects Speedy. When Pac-Man is moving or facing up, the spot Bashful uses to
 * draw the line is two squares above and left of Pac-Man.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;

	 * &lt;b&gt;Implementation:&lt;/b&gt; by lack of a coordinate system there is a
	 * workaround: first determine the square of Blinky (A) and the square 2
	 * squares away from Pac-Man (B). Then determine the shortest path from A to
	 * B regardless of terrain and walk that same path from B. This is the
	 * destination.
